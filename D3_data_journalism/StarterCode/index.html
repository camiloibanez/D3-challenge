          <h2>Correlations:</h2>
          <ul>
            <h3>Poverty Correlations</h3>
            <li>There was a positive correlation between percent of people in each state in poverty and the percent of people who lacked healthcare of 0.52</li>
            <li>There was a positive correlation between percent of people in each state in poverty and the percent who were obese of 0.46</li>
            <li>There was a positive correlation between percent of people in each state in poverty and the percent who smoke of 0.52</li>

            <h3>Age Correlations</h3>
            <li>There was a positive correlation of median age and percent who smoke of 0.24. Having a smoking habit is more prevalent among older people. Perhaps people got addicted to tobacco products before the health effects of them were known and continued the habit since then.</li>
            <li>There was a negative correlation of median age with percent who lack healthcare of -0.38. The older you get the more likely you are to have healthcare.</li>
            
            <h3>Income Correlations</h3>
            <li>Median income had a strong negative correlation of -0.65 with the percent of people who are obese</li>
            <li>Median income had a strong negative correlation of -0.66 with the percent of people who smoke</li>
            <li>Median income had a strong negative correlation of -0.43 with the percent of people who lack healthcare</li>
            <h3>Smoking and Obesity</h3>
            <li>Lack of Healthcare had a positive correlation with the percent who are obese of 0.36. We don’t know if the lack of healthcare leads to more allowing attitudes towards obesity or that there is a third variable, such as income, that relates to both factors and makes it more difficult to afford a healthy diet and time to exercise as well as healthcare benefits.</li>
            <li>The strongest correlation was a positive correlation between obesity and a smoking habit of 0.74. A smoking habit is also more prevalent among the obese and vice versa. It seems lax standards of personal health spread across aspects of one’s life.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Overall, it is clear the way to improve someone’s standard of living is to help raise them into a higher income bracket. This will impact their health, their habits, and their coverage.</p>
